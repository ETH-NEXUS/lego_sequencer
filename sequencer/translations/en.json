    "general": "Surprisingly, a BLAST search shows similarities to genetic material from the following species: {species}.",
    "egfr": "In fact, the sequence aligns to the EGFR gene, specifically within the kinase domain hotspot covering exons 18\u201319. This region often harbors clinically relevant variants such as: \u2022 G719X (G719A/C/S) in exon 18 \u2014 a substitution in the ATP-binding site that can subtly activate signaling, \u2022 E709K or E709_T710delinsD \u2014 hinge-position changes that affect the switch mechanism, \u2022 Canonical exon 19 deletions (e.g., E746_A750del, L747_A750insP, L747_T751del) \u2014 small loop trims that favor the 'on' state of the kinase. In this case, the sequence contains notable variants: {variants}. At the protein level, the observed sequence ({aa_seq_q}) differs from the reference ({aa_seq_r}), starting at amino acid position {aa_offset}. Such alterations are known to influence EGFR signaling and drug sensitivity, making them both a diagnostic clue and a therapeutic hint.",
    "cftr": "In fact, the sequence aligns to the CFTR gene, mutations of which cause cystic fibrosis \u2014 a condition where disrupted chloride transport leads to thick mucus, chronic infections, and multi-organ complications. Within a narrow stretch of exon 10, multiple nearby mutations can cause cystic fibrosis in different ways: \u2022 Folding defects (\u0394F508-like) \u2014 the protein misfolds and never reaches the cell surface, \u2022 Gating defects (G551D-like) \u2014 the protein is present but opens too rarely, \u2022 Splice-altering variants \u2014 the protein is produced at much lower levels or not at all. In this case, the sequence contains notable variants: {variants}. At the protein level, the observed sequence ({aa_seq_q}) differs from the reference ({aa_seq_r}), starting at amino acid position {aa_offset}. Such alterations can shift CFTR from well-folded and functional to misfolded, absent, or present-but-reluctant to open. Therapies are now tailored to the mutation class \u2014 for example, correctors to improve folding or potentiators to enhance gating \u2014 making CFTR a prime example of precision medicine in action.",
    "warfarin": "In fact, the sequence aligns to the {gene} gene, which plays a key role in determining individual sensitivity to the anticoagulant drug warfarin. Variants in VKORC1 (aa 28\u201346) can alter the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, affecting clotting factor activation. Variants in CYP2C9 (aa 355\u2013363) can change the metabolism rate of warfarin itself, influencing how long the drug remains active in the body. In this case, the sequence contains notable variants: {variants}. At the protein level, the observed sequence ({aa_seq_q}) differs from the reference ({aa_seq_r}), starting at amino acid position {aa_offset}. Such changes can make a standard warfarin dose either too strong (risking bleeding) or too weak (risking clot formation), underscoring why genotype-guided dosing is now part of precision anticoagulation therapy.",
    "sars2_rbd": "In fact, the sequence aligns to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, specifically the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a hotspot for mutations that influence binding to the ACE2 receptor and antibody recognition. Wastewater surveillance detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments shed by infected individuals, and because these genomes are pooled and often degraded, targeted sequencing of key sites like the RBD is essential. Mutations here can vary in their functional impact \u2014 for example, K417T/N, L452R/Q, E484K/Q, F490S, N501Y \u2014 but when seen together, they form a distinct 'fingerprint' that can identify a variant even from fragmented data. In this case, the sequence contains notable mutations: {variants}. Common RBD mutation fingerprints (aa 417\u2013554) include: \u2022 Alpha (B.1.1.7): N501Y \u2022 Beta (B.1.351): K417N, E484K, N501Y \u2022 Gamma (P.1): K417T, E484K, N501Y \u2022 Delta (B.1.617.2): L452R, T478K \u2022 Omicron (BA.1): G339D, S371L, S373P, S375F, K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H \u2022 Mu (B.1.621): R346K, E484K, N501Y \u2022 Iota (B.1.526): E484K \u2022 Lambda (C.37): L452Q, F490S. At the protein level, the observed sequence ({aa_seq_q}) differs from the reference ({aa_seq_r}), starting at amino acid position {aa_offset}. Such fingerprints allow tracking of co-circulating variants in wastewater, helping detect emerging strains before they appear in clinical sequencing data."
